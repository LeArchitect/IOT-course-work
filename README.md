Device to device communication program for a IOT course

The program uses Integrated sensors of the phone to measure:
Humidity, Temperature, Luminosity and Battery level

The measurements are then queued and sent throught TCP/IP to server side which displays the data.
This iteration works for now with tops 2 clients.
